# ATS Resources

The purpose of this page is to provide an aggregation of the many great resources available online to learn ATS. A short description is provided for each website or resource to help you decide what resources might be useful to you as you learn.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dpneary/ATS-Intro/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Video Tutorials

The following are useful video tutorials for learning the ATS language.

### I Suck at ATS - Video Series

This 15-part video series provides a great introduction into ATS and then jumps in with some fun examples before going more in-depth with some of ATS's more advanced features. Note that some of the later videos in this series do not include voice-overs but still include typed descriptions and commentary of what is happening.

### Intro to ATS - Video Series

This 10-part video series on the ATS language's official youtube page provides a great look at the main components of the language. Videos are seperated by topic and include all the classic topics such as datatypes, functions, and best practices, as well as topics more specific to ATS.

### A (Not So Gentle) Introduction To Systems Programming In ATS - Video

This quick and somewhat humorous tutorial gives a great high-level overview of the features, quirks, and syntax of ATS. It is useful for those who just want a general overview of the language before performing a deeper dive.

# Written Tutorials and Examples

The following are useful written tutorials and learn-by-example solutions for learning the ATS language.

### Introduction to Programming in ATS

This 250+ page book on ATS is an in-depth look at the language and comes from the official ATS wesbite. It is by far the most complete guide to ATS. The official website provides this description:

"This book starts from the core of ATS, a statically typed call-by-value functional programming language, gradually introducing the reader to dependent types, linear types and the paradigm of programming with theorem-proving. It assumes no familiarity of the reader with functional programming but it does expect the reader to have already acquired basic understanding of programming and possibly some programming skills."

### Tutorial on Programming Features in ATS

This book provides over 90 pages of examples of programming features in ATS. It assumes some knowledge of programming off the bat, but is useful for those looking to transition from another language rather than learn from scratch. The official website provides this description:

"The primary purpose of this tutorial is to bring insights into a rich set of programming features in ATS and also demonstrate through concrete examples that these features can be made of effective use in the construction of high-quality programs. For someone familiar with both ML and C, it is possible to learn programming in ATS by simply studying the tutorial. However, a coherent and systematic view of ATS is diffcult to be gained from the tutorial alone."

### A Crash into Functional Programming via ATS

This guide focuses on a functional programming, a programming paradigm that ATS is uniquely suited for. This is great read and can provides great insight for those not used to the functional style. The official website provides this description:

"This book consists of a set of lecture notes for a crash course on functional programming in ATS. The primary focus of these notes is set upon advocating a style of problem-solving that makes extensive use of list-processing and stream-processing functions. After finishing this course, one will have become familiar with recursion in problem-solving and ready to formulate high-level combinator-based programming solutions."

### Effective Programming in ATS through Examples

This is the last of the officially provided ATS resources, and is a list of several common programming problems and challenges. Examples include the Hanoi Towers, the Dining Philosophers problem, and using combinators. In total, 30 examples are provided.

### ATS Examples by Bluish Coder

This is a series of more than 30 more advanced examples for the coder who already has a decent grasp on ATS (though complete knowledge is by no means nessecary). This series is from a semi-active blog so expect more examples to be added too.

### ML programmer's guide to ATS

This is a brief overview of ATS mean for those who have familiarity with ML, a language in the same family as ATS. It covers mostly syntax differences and can get an ML programmer up to speed quickly.

### Teaching Examples of Steinway Wu

This last resource comes from the personal blog of a former TA for a class on ATS. Scattered throughout the blog are many examples and helpful tips for ATS. Though it is not a full-fledged guide itself, it can come in handy for topics not covered by any of the other resources.
