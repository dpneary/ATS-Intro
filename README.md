# ATS Resources

The purpose of this page is to provide an aggregation of the many great resources available online to learn ATS. A short description is provided for each website or resource to help you decide what resources might be useful to you as you learn.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dpneary/ATS-Intro/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Video Tutorials

The following are useful video tutorials for learning the ATS language.


## I Suck at ATS - Video Series

This 15-part video series provides a great introduction into ATS and then jumps in with some fun examples before going more in-depth with some of ATS's more advanced features. Note that some of the later videos in this series do not include voice-overs but still include typed descriptions and commentary of what is happening.
